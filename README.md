# tiny-java-containers

An example showing how a simple Java application can be compiled to produce a
very small Docker container image.

The smallest container images contains just an executable.  But since there's
nothing in the container image except the executable, including no libc or other
shared libraries, the executable has to be fully statically linked with all
needed libraries and resources.

To support static linking libc, GraalVM Native Image supports using the
"lightweight, fast, simple, free" [musl](https://musl.libc.org/) libc
implementation.

**NOTE**: GraalVM Native Image also supports dynamically linked and "[mostly
static](https://www.graalvm.org/22.0/reference-manual/native-image/StaticImages/)"
executables not described here.

## Prerequisites

You'll need GraalVM Native Image installed.  This code was last tested with
version 22.1.  You'll also need Docker installed and running.  It should work
fine with [podman](https://podman.io/) but it has not been tested.

These instructions have only been tested on Linux amd64.

## Setup and Build

Clone this Git repo and in your shell type the following to download and
configure the MUSL toolchain.

![](images/keyboard.jpg) `% source setup-musl.sh`

Next compile a simple single Java class Hello World application with `javac`, compile
the generated .class file into a fully statically linked native Linux
executable, compress the executable with [upx](https://upx.github.io/), and
package both the static executable and the compressed executable into `scratch`
Docker container images using the provided script:

![](images/keyboard.jpg) `% ./build-hello.sh`

## The Executables

Running either of the executable you can see they are functionally equivalent.
They just print "Hello World". But there are a few points worth noting:

1. The executable generated by GraalVM Native Image using the 
   `--static --libc=musl` options is a fully self-contained executable which can be
   confirmed by examining it with `ldd`:

![](images/keyboard.jpg) `% ldd hello.static`

should result in:

```shell
	not a dynamic executable
```

Unfortunately `upx` compression renders `ldd` unable to list the shared
libraries of an executable, but since we compressed the statically linked
executable we can be confident it is also statically linked.

2. Both executables are the result of compiling a Java bytecode application into
   native machine code. The uncompressed executable is only 5.2MB!  There's no
   JVM, no jars, no JIT compiler and none of the overhead it imposes.  Both
   start extremely fast as there is effectively no startup cost.
3. The `upx` compressed executable is about 60% smaller, 1.5MB vs. 5.2MB! With
   upx the application self-extracts but so quickly as to have [minimal impact
   on startup
   time](https://medium.com/graalvm/compressed-graalvm-native-images-4d233766a214).  

## Container Images

The sizes of the `scratch`-based container images are in proportion to the
executables.  

```shell
REPOSITORY          TAG                 IMAGE ID            CREATED             SIZE
hello               upx                 935e5e3549e6        1 second ago        1.51MB
hello               static              4d41b253b760        4 seconds ago       5.45MB
```
These are tiny container images and yet they contain fully functional and
deployable (although fairly useless 😉) applications.

The Dockerfiles that generated them simply copy the executable
into the container image and set the executable as the `ENTRYPOINT`.  E.g.,

```docker
FROM scratch
COPY hello.upx /
ENTRYPOINT ["/hello.upx"]
```

Running them is straightforward:

![](images/keyboard.jpg) `% docker run --rm hello:static`

```shell
Hello World
```

![](images/keyboard.jpg) `% docker run --rm hello:upx`

```shell
Hello World
```

## Wrapping Up

There you have it.  A fully functional, albeit minimal, Java application
compiled into a native Linux executable and packaged into a `scratch` container
image thanks to GraalVM Native Image's support for fully static linking with the
`musl` libc.
